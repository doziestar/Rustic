# Rustic: Real-Time, Distributed Machine Learning System

Rustic is a cutting-edge, distributed machine learning system designed for real-time data processing and learning, built entirely in Rust. It's engineered to handle large-scale data streams, perform real-time predictions, and continuously update its models with minimal latency. Rustic stands out for its robustness, speed, and fault tolerance, making it an ideal solution for high-throughput, real-time ML applications.

## Features

- **Distributed Data Processing**: Efficiently processes data from multiple sources in real-time, distributing the workload across multiple nodes.
- **Real-Time Learning and Prediction**: Capable of updating ML models on-the-fly for instant predictions.
- **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**: Designed to scale seamlessly with data volume and maintain operations despite node failures.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a Web API for easy interaction, data submission, and system monitoring.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Offers a real-time monitoring dashboard for system metrics like throughput, prediction accuracy, and more.
